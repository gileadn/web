        <h3>history</h3>
        <img class="img_abt" src="../../image/about_history.jpg" height="183" width="275" />
        <p>
            Before investors yelled across trade floors and threw order forms into the air,<br/>
            they conducted business in coffee shops.  Early stocks were handwritten on <br/>
            sheets of paper, and investors traded these stocks with other investors in<br/>
            coffee shops.<br/>
            <br/>
            Nobody really understood the importance of the stock market in those early<br/>
            days. People realized it was powerful and valuable, but nobody truly understood <br/>
            exactly what it would become.

            <p>
                It's over. <br/>
                Now everyone can invest in the stock exchange from anywhere at any<br/>
                time. Today people bring their money to investment companies and <br/>
                society plays with your in money. It's scary to give someone else a mandate <br/>
                on your money, so we let you come and choose where you invest your money. <br/>
                We provide you with all the information you need to make the right decision <br/>
                even without prior knowledge and all with the click of a button.<br/>
                The future is already here.
